<p>
I'm currently a Software Engineering Manager for Jack Henry and Associates and work with the Web Solutions 
team in building custom web sites and applications.
</p>

<p>I'm also into making music and music related things (like guitars, amps, synthesizers, etc.)</p>

<p>As well as music, movies, books, etc.</p>

<p>
    Being from Memphis and being southern, I particularly enjoy Blues, Soul, Rockabilly, and Southern Gothic.
    But I also love classic cinema and cult cinema as well as classic literature.
